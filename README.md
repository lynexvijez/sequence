## 📘 Arithmetic Sequence Generator – Python Documentation
### 🔍 Overview
This simple Python script generates an arithmetic sequence based on three user-defined parameters:

Starting number (start)

Common difference (increment)

Total number of terms (terms)

🧮 What is an Arithmetic Sequence?
An arithmetic sequence is a list of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

General formula:

𝑎
𝑛
=
𝑎
+
(
𝑛
−
1
)
𝑑
a 
n
​
 =a+(n−1)d
Where:

𝑎
a is the first term (start)

𝑑
d is the common difference (increment)

𝑛
n is the term number

🧾 Code Explanation

start = 5            # The first number in the sequence
increment = 3        # The fixed amount added to each term
terms = 8            # Total number of elements to generate

# Generate the arithmetic sequence using a list comprehension
sequence = [start + i * increment for i in range(terms)]

# Display the generated sequence
print("Your sequence...", sequence)
🔧 How It Works
Step 1: Initialize the parameters:

start = 5

increment = 3

terms = 8

Step 2: Use a list comprehension to generate the sequence:


[start + i * increment for i in range(terms)]
This generates each term by adding the product of the index i and increment to the start value.

Step 3: Output the sequence using print().

✅ Output

Your sequence... [5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26]
Each number is created by repeatedly adding 3 to the previous term, starting from 5.

🎯 Summary
Parameter	Value
Start	5
Increment	3
No. of Terms	8
Output	[5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26]

💡 Bonus Tip
You can easily modify start, increment, or terms to generate different arithmetic sequences. Try using input() to make it interactive!
